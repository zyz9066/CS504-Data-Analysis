## About the code

The code is written in Python with Jupyter Notebook which is a tool that allows to combine live coding, explanatory text, visualizations, and equations. Thus, the source code for processing is self-explanatory and relevant comments are added to the file.

As for viewers, it doesn't need to run the code. So for the libraries used in this project, kindly refer to project report for details.
